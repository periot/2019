            "text": "Second International Workshop on Mobile and Pervasive Internet of Things (PerIoT 2019)\n\n\n (co-located with \nIEEE PerCom 2019\n)\n\n\n March 11-15, 2019, Koyoto, Japan\n\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of modern wireless telecommunications. The IoT enables large numbers of previously unconnected devices to communicate and exchange data and deal with services that span areas from healthcare to transportation and much more, with the potential for significant benefits to people and quality of life. The IoT would also enable a range of new capabilities and services far beyond today's offerings, which will radically change the life styles of future human generation. In recent years, Internet has become increasingly pervasive. Besides allowing people to connect anytime and everywhere to achieve pervasiveness and allow mobility, the Internet is evolving into the communication medium for objects that are embedded in the real world. The coupling among mobile technology, such objects and a worldwide pervasive communication infrastructure constitutes the Mobile and Pervasive Internet of Things. The mobile and pervasive IoT enables a detailed characterization of the real physical applications, as well as a rich set of pervasive interactions with the physical world. As such, the mobile and pervasive IoT has the potential to revolutionize future pervasive applications and influence the real world entities in to achieve better quality of life for future generation of human.\n\n\nThis workshop (PerIoT) solicits high-quality papers presenting original research results on the overlapping area of IoT applications facilitating the vision of mobile and pervasive computing. We aim to focus on general research problems arising from the pervasive interaction and communication of mobile and IoT devices in physical world. Some of these research challenges may include: conflicting standards, suitable networks protocols, bandwidth scarcity, device fragmentation (servers to TVs, phones to sensors), content organization, security, data privacy, testing automation and etc. Thus, the aim of this workshop is to bring together practitioners and researchers from both academia and industry in order to have a forum for discussion and technical presentations on the recent advances in the area of mobile and pervasive IoT. It furthermore serves as a forum for the research community to discuss open issues, novel solutions and the future development of mobile and pervasive IoT applications. Submissions could consist of theoretical and applied research in topics including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nSystem architectures for the IoT targeted to pervasive scenarios\n\n\nMiddleware and platforms for pervasive IoT applications\n\n\nSecurity and privacy in pervasive IoT scenarios\n\n\nInteroperability of protocols for IoT\n\n\nContext awareness in the pervasive IoT\n\n\nExperiences in building pervasive IoT platforms\n\n\nPervasive applications built on top of the IoT\n\n\nEnabling technologies and standards for the IoT\n\n\nRouting protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) in IoT\n\n\nPower consumption and optimization in pervasive IoT\n\n\nIoT platforms for BigData and Data analytics on pervasive environments\n\n\nFault-tolerance and reliability in Pervasive IoT applications\n\n\n\n\nImportant Dates\n\n\nPapers submission deadline: \nNovember 10, 2018\n\nAuthor notification due: \nDecember 22, 2018\n\nCamera ready deadline: \nJanuary 11, 2019 (FIRM)\n\nAuthor registration deadline: \nJanuary 11, 2019 (FIRM)\n\nWorkshop date: \nTBD\n\n\nCall for Papers (CFP)\n\n\nLink\n\n\nSubmission and Registration\n\n\nAuthors are invited to submit regular (full) papers for presentation at the workshop, describing original, previously unpublished work, which is not currently under review by another workshop, conference, or journal. Regular papers should present novel perspectives within the general scope of the workshop.\n\n\nPerIoT is \nsingle-blind\n. Papers may be no more than \n6 pages\n in length. Papers in excess of page limits shall not be considered for review or publication. All papers must be typeset in double-column IEEE format using 10pt fonts on US letter paper, with all fonts embedded. The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as related information, can be found at the IEEE Computer Society website. Submissions must be made via \nEDAS\n.\n\n\nIt is a requirement that all authors listed in the submitted paper are also listed in EDAS. The author section of EDAS will be locked after the workshop submission deadline to ensure that conflict-of-interest can be properly enforced during review. If the list of authors differs between the paper and EDAS, the paper may not be reviewed. The authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop. \nAt least one author of each accepted paper must be registered at full rate for that paper to appear in the proceedings and to be scheduled for presentation\n.\n\n\nEach accepted paper will require a full PerCom conference registration (no registration is available for workshops only).\n\n\nWorkshop papers will be included and indexed in the IEEE digital libraries (Xplore).\n\n\nSubmission link: \nhttp://edas.info/N25225\n\n\nOrganizers\n\n\n \nCo-Chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndadul Hoque\n\n    Florida International University, Miami FL\n\n    Email: ehoque@fiu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarzana Rahman\n\n    Florida International University, Miami FL\n\n    Email: farahman@fiu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuya Ghazizadeh\n\n    Steton Hall University, NJ\n\n    Email: puya.ghazizadeh@shu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTechnical Program Committee\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n \nPublicity Chair\n\n\n\n\nChristian Krupitzer\n\n    University of Mannheim\n\n\n\n\nHotel and Venue Information\n\n\nInformation\n\n\nPrevious workshops\n\n\n\n\nPerIot 2018\n\n\nPerIot 2017",
